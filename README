# Flask Testable Application

## Introduction

This project is designed to demonstrate good design and testing practices in a Python Flask application. It includes a task manager with basic CRUD operations.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd yourrepository
    ```
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```
    python -m venv .venv
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
4. Install the required packages:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5. Set up the database:
    ```
    flask db init
    flask db migrate
    flask db upgrade
    ```
6. Run the application:
    ```
    flask run
    ```

## Design Philosophy

The application is designed with separation of concerns in mind. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. The `models.py` file defines the database models, the `services.py` file contains the business logic, and the `routes.py` file handles the routing and presentation logic.

## Testing Philosophy

The application uses unit tests to ensure each part of the application works as expected. The tests are located in the `tests` directory. Each service and route has its own test file. The tests use the `unittest` package and a SQLite in-memory database for isolation between tests.

To run the tests, use the following command:
```
pytest
```
